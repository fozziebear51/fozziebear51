- 👋 Hi, I’m @fozziebear51
- 👀 I’m interested in learning new things often. I am looking to learn web dev as throughout my proffessional life, I have constantly felt like an outsider so I wanted to learn something that is shared throughout the world and be part of an actual community of people.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basic of HTML and CSS through the Project Odin platform.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on TBC
- 📫 How to reach me, on here!
